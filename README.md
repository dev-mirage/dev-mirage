## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly code in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) but I'm also planning to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) some time! I'm currently making [Liquidify](https://github.com/ethan-davies/liquidify)! 

I've contributed to a few projects here on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and still planning to keep it that way. 

If you want to find out more about me visit my [Website](https://ethandavies.co.uk/)!
