## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

My name is Ethan Davies and I'm a student and self-taught programmer from the United Kingdom, constantly trying to enhance my skills by learning new technologies and frameworks. One of my goals is to learn Rust to a comfortable degree and to further contribute to the open-source movement. I love to write code for both the frontend and backend primarily using TypeScript.

I'm working on many projects, some of them being; CheatBreaker, a free FPS boosting modpack for Minecraft versions 1.7 and 1.8. Surge, a customisable and modern Minecraft Launcher for creating unique instances and SkinBook, a customisable platform for sharing Minecraft profiles.

If you would like to contact me, do so by emailing contact@ethandavies.co.uk.
