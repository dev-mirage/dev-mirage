## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Ethan**, I mostly program in [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and I love making my projects compatible with [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)! I'm currently making [**Mock**](https://github.com/ethan-davies/mock) which is a new shell written in Go! 

I also the lead developer of the [**dull.js**](https://github.com/dulljs) project and have contributed to many other projects all on here, [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) and am planning to continue to use the platform.
