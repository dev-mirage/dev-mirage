## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly code in [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and I love making my projects compatible with [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)! I'm currently making [**Mock**](https://github.com/ethan-davies/mock) which is a new shell written in Go! 

I am the owner of [**dull.js**](https://github.com/dulljs) and I've contributed to many other projects all on here, [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) and am planning to continue to use the platform. 

If you want to find out more about me visit my [**Website**](https://ethandavies.co.uk/)!
