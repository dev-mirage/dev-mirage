## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I mostly code in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) but I'm also planning to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) some time! I'm currently making [Byte](https://github.com/ethan-davies/byte) which is a type of NoSQL JSON database! 

I am the owner of [Mango](https://github.com/development-mango) and I've contributed to many other projects all on here, [GitHub](https://github.com/) and am planning to continue to use the platform. 

If you want to find out more about me visit my [Website](https://ethandavies.co.uk/)!
